# Academic-Archive
This is a comprehensive archive of programming and computer science-related work done throughout my education. Each individual folder will be described (note that using .gitignore projects that are already committed to GitHub are not present here, but in their own separate repositories.

# CEC-322: Microcontroller Systems Lab
Programming TivaWare MCUs (WIP)

# CS-118: Intro to Programming
Not my first experience with programming, but this class was the first university programming class I took. We completed various basic assignments and objectives with Python.

# CS-125: Computer Science I
The prerequisite class for everything within software engineering. All work was programmed in C, and there are various lessons, assignments, and homework demonstrating certain programming concepts.

# CS-225: Computer Science II
The class directly after CS-125, and this time we coded in C++. This class includes more advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), and it includes a team project where my partner and I programmed a casino game (project is located in a separate repository).

# CS-315: Data Structures and Algorithms
This class introduced us to ideas of time complexity and a variety of data structures that we experimented with in C. Various demonstrations and examples of ideas learned from data structures and algorithms are included. (WIP)

# CS-399: Intermediate Python
A special class I opted into after CS-118. This class delved more deeply into Python in order to teach us aspects that would be important for real-world development. We learned more about concepts we touched on before in CS-118, and we learned about new, important aspects in development like virtual environments, APIs, and machine learning within Python. 

# CS-420: Operating Systems
Extra credit assignments I opted to do to improve my knowledge and understanding of operating systems. Each assignment corresponds to a unit we learn and write about regarding OS's and how they function.
